# DATA301
Backup for Cal Poly DATA 301 course taught by Brian Granger

This includes Brain Granger's class work as well as my own work for exercises, extra credit (slopolice), and final project.

This course includes learning materials for python language, pandas, numpy, altair, and scipy libraries for the purpose of creating meaningfl visualizations and models with large sets of data.
